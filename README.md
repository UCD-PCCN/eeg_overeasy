# eeg_overeasy
To make an ohm-lette you have to crack a few EEGs

Eeg_overeasy allows users to get data quality metrics (from Luck paper) and  conduct efficent power analyses on small amount of preliminary EEG
pilot data. The desing allows users the fexlibility to specify the type of anaylsis on for which data quality and power and be computed, as well 
control details of the analysis such boot-strap iterations on both first and second levels. Methods for visualiztion are primarily restricted to EEG components and boot straping analyses.

All of this is can be done from the online GUI 
located here : 

or by dowloading and implimenting the class in custom scripts
