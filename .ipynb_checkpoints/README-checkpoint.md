Eeg_overeasy allows users to analyze data quality and conduct power analyses on a small amount of representative EEG data. Currently this tool works specifically for mean amplitude ERP analysis, but in the future it may be expanded to other EEG/ERP analysis strategies.

This tool can be accessed through an online GUI located here :

or by dowloading and implementing the class in custom scripts.

## Inputs

### _Mandatory_

##### Data files

Eeg_overeasy will load any number of raw EEG files in most common formats (cnt, bdf, eeg) into MNE, and requires a montage file of electrode number and locations. These files should be pre-processed to whatever extent the user wishes the power analysis to be conducted on (filtered, artifact rejected, ICA-corrected, etc.). For use in the online GUI, these files should be named per subject ID and placed in a folder with a montage file.

##### *Sample rate - in ms (? check if actually needed)*

##### Events - as list of integers

User must specify which events in the files correspond to EEG related to the stimuli which is to be analyzed. The events need not exactly represent the planned manipulation, but they do need to represent the same sort of stimuli. User can specify any number of events, but they will all be treated equivalently so they should all be similar stimuli so as to not bias the estimate of data quality. If the user wishes to use the option to run the power analysis at different numbers of items, it should be noted that maximum number items which can be included in the power analysis is equal to the number of items included in any of the data files uploaded.

##### Epoch - in ms

The time epoch specified should represent the timing of whatever ERP component the user is interested in analyzing. This epoch will be used to measure the mean amplitude of EEG data for every event in every file.

### _Optional_

##### Electrodes - as list of stings

User may specify a list of electrodes to conduct the power/data quality analysis on. The analysis will default to all electrodes if this parameter is left blank. The chosen electrodes should reflect which electodes would be used to analyze an effect on whichever component ERP comonent is being analyzed. The electrodes must be specified as a list of strings which exactly match the according electrode label in the header of the montage file.

#### _Additional power analysis inputs_

User must specify at least one argument for each of the 3 inputs below. If item analysis is checked, one of the inputs must only have one argument. If two inputs have multiple arguments (e.g. Subjects: [20, 30, 40], Effect size: [1, 2, 3], and Items : [Default]), then the power analyis will return a table of possible powers (in this case it would be 3[Subjects] x 3[Items], all at an effect size of 1mv).

###### Effect size

User must specify an effect size. Ideally, this is based on previous research. EEG_overeasy allows for the power analysis to be conducted on up to 4 effect sizes.

###### Subject sample

User must specify the number of subjects for the power analysis to use. As many as 4 sample sizes can be used.

###### Item sample

User must specify the number of items per subject for the power analysis to use (to bootstrap based on). As many as 4 number of items can be used. If left blank, this defaults to the maximum number of possible items.


## Data quality estimate

For every electrode, item, and subject included, mean amplitude EEG measurements are taken using the epoch specified. Then mean amplitudes are averaged across items to get an mean for each electrode and subject. To estimate the data quality, the standard error around these means are estimated using bootstrapping. Per electode, these estimates will then be averaged across subjects, to give the best estimate for the average quality of a subject's data from this specific recording enviroment. Then, these data quality estimates will be output to the user in the form of a table (and maybe some plots...), and passed to the power analysis function.

## Power analysis

This function uses the bootstrapped estimates of the standard error to conduct a t-test power analysis for the given effect size and different numbers of subjects (15, 20, 25, 30?). The analyses will be run for each electrode specified, as well as for an average. (plots...?)
